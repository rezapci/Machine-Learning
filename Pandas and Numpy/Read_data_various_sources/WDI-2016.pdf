SDG 6 Clean water and sanitation

Ensure availability  Despite halving the number of people worldwide without access to an
and sustainable      improved water source over the past 25 years, the poorest countries

of water and         tion to all. Just over a quarter of people in low-income countries have
sanitation for all   access to an improved sanitation facility, compared with just over half
                     in lower middle-income countries. Delivery of water supply and sanita-
                     tion is not just a challenge of service provision; it is intrinsically linked
                     with climate change, water resources management, water scarcity, and
                     water quality.

SDG 12 Responsible consumption and production

consumption     would be enough to feed 870 million people.1 Sustainable consumption
and production  and production by countries—in essence doing more and better with less

a. Based on nominal per capita consumption averages and distributions estimated parametrically from unit-record household survey data, unless otherwise noted. b. Refers to the period
of reference of a survey. For surveys in which the period of reference covers multiple years, it is the first year. c. Estimated nonparametrically from nominal income per capita distributions
based on unit-record household survey data. d. Covers urban areas only. e. Because the 2011 purchasing power parity (PPP) estimate needs to be further analyzed, the 2005 estimate
is used. Thus data listed for the $1.90 a day poverty line refer to the $1.25 a day poverty line, and data listed for the $3.10 a day poverty line refer to the $2 a day poverty line. f. Based
on PPP dollars imputed using regression. g. Based on benchmark national PPP estimate rescaled to account for cost-of-living differences in urban and rural areas. The national estimates
are the population-weighted average of urban and rural estimates. h. Estimated nonparametrically from nominal consumption per capita distributions based on grouped household survey
data. i. Based on per capita income averages and distribution data estimated parametrically from grouped household survey data.

                     Environmental Benefits Statement

The World Bank Group is committed to reducing its environmental footprint.
In support of this commitment, the Publishing and Knowledge Division lever-
ages electronic publishing options and print-on-demand technology, which is
located in regional hubs worldwide. Together, these initiatives enable print
runs to be lowered and shipping distances decreased, resulting in reduced
paper consumption, chemical use, greenhouse gas emissions, and waste.

    The Publishing and Knowledge Division follows the recommended stan-
dards for paper use set by the Green Press Initiative. The majority of our
books are printed on Forest Stewardship Council (FSC)–certified paper, with
nearly all containing 50–100 percent recycled content. The recycled fiber in
our book paper is either unbleached or bleached using totally chlorine-free
(TCF), processed chlorine-free (PCF), or enhanced elemental chlorine-free
(EECF) processes.

    More information about the Bank’s environmental philosophy can be
found at http://www.worldbank.org/corporateresponsibility.
